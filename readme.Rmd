# NRI.Rproj

NRI.Rproj is an R project file used to produce analysis and figures related to an ongoing cross-factorial mass mortality experiment at the Nobel Research Institute (NRI) that began in Spring 2019.

## Producing images for the storyboard assignment

Execute the scripts in the following order

```bash
concept_diagram.R creates the ggplot object "diagram"

seed_GLM.R creates the ggplot object "bank"

spec_time.R creates the ggplot object "panel_c"

run veg.R creates the ggplot object "ord_final"

storyboard.R saves these ggplot objects as jpeg files

images must scaled down 40% before submission to meet journal requirements

```

## PACKETS_SPRING_2020.csv [data]
```bash
Germination & survival data for carrion seed experiment to be used in seed_GLM.R

SITE # location of plots (WP = Wellpad, OS = Oswalt triangle, DF = Dixon Fence, GG = Gilgai

PLOT # subplot nested within site

BIOMASS # level of carrion biomass (M = Mass mortality/high, C = Control/single carcass/low)

TREATMENT # exclusion treatment simulating death of animal functional group (S = Scavenger, H = Herbivore, O = open)

PACKET # location of mesh seed packet simulating seed bank or seed rain (BA = Bank adjacent, BU = Bank under/proximal, AA = After adjacent, AT = After top/proximal)

TYPE # Seed functional group (ND = No dormancy, PD = Physiological dormancy, PY = physical dormancy)

SPECIES # Plant species (MASY = Malus sylvestris, TRAE = Triticum aestivum, SIALD = Sinapis alba, RHGL = Rhus glabra, SYRIN = Syringa sp, PISY = Pinus sylvestris, BIOR = Bixa orellana, HOVU = Hordeum vulgare, BEVU2 = Beta vulgaris, CAAN4 = Capiscum annum, GLMA4 = Glycine max, PISA6 = Pisum sativum)

ID # Seed subsample number 

FINAL.STATUS # Survival of seeds (0 = unretrieved/dead, 1 = retrieved/germinated)

```

## func_veg_rel.csv.csv [data]
```bash
Plant community composition matrix aggregated into functional groups and relativized (as fraction of total biomass) to be used in spec_time.R

ND # Plants with non-dormant seeds

PD #  Plants with seeds exhibiting physiological dormancy

PY # Plants with seeds exhibiting physical dormancy

NONE # ground absent of living plants (i.e., covered with carrion, dead plants, bare ground, or litter)

```

## OKMME_veg.csv [data]
```bash
Plant community composition matrix delineated by species to be used in veg.R 

Site # Location of plots (WP = Wellpad, OS = Oswalt triangle, DF = Dixon Fence, GG = Gilgai

Treatment # Combination of exclusion and carrion biomass (M = Mass mortality/high, C = Control/single carcass/low, S = Scavenger, H = Herbivore, O = open)

Month, Day, Year, Date # Sampling date

Species are listed as USDA plant codes.
